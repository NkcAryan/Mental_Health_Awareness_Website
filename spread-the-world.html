        <div class="talking-heading">Reasons why talking about mental health matters.</div>
        <div class="talking-point">To combat mental health stigma.</div>
        <div class="talking-description">The stigma surrounding mental health is still very much prevalent up to this
            day.
            This stigma forces a lot of the brave people struggling with mental illnesses and disorders to keep their
            heads down and their
            mouths shut. This can prevent us from recognizing when we need to reach out for help and possibly save
            somebody's life.</div>
        <div class="talking-description">Talking about mental issues allows us to discover just how common it is in
            everyday people.
            It will also provide us with the opportunity to correct common misconceptions and established prejudices.
        </div>

        <div class="talking-point">To encourage action.</div>
        <div class="talking-description">By creating discussions around the topic we will feel comfortable enough to
            recognize
            when we need help and have the knowledge of where to seek it. Being more open about mental health struggles
            will foster a
            more transparent community, where people will understand that they are not alone in their inner battles.
        </div>

        <div class="talking-point">To maintain good mental health.</div>
        <div class="talking-description">Mental illness is only one aspect of mental health. All of us have mental
            health
            that we should learn to cherish and nurture. Talking about mental health can encourage us to improve our
            inner wellbeing
            regularly. Various tips and tricks to bolster our mental health should be given in the same casual manner
            and frequency as
            it is with our physical health.</div>

            organizations, charities, and
            support groups help celebrate and bring awareness to the importance of mental wellbeing and preservation of
            one's mental health.</div>
        <div class="world-mental-health-day-body"> There are around 450 million people with mental or neurological
            disorders, who
            continually face stigma, discrimination, and who do not have access to proper support and guidance from
            professsionals.</div>
        <div class="world-mental-health-day-heading">This day's purpose is to raise awareness around mental health
